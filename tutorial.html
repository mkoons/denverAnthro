                <p>
                     When you participate, the platform will load a scanned index card from the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (DMNS) Anthopology Department
                    (stored on the MicroPasts <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/micropasts/albums/72157669446657984">Flickr</a> stream).
                    Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked to transcribe the contents of each
                    card. Some of the fields are no longer needed, for example, "Former Catalog No" and "Storage or Display location." Only enter the information that is asked for in the fields below the image.
                    An example of a card is shown below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each index card contains similar information and we are asking you to enter this information
                    into a set of pre-defined fields. In addition to the help provided by this tutorial, you will also
                    find further hints inside the data entry boxes about where on the card the relevant information might be found.

            	<p>
            	Sometimes you might notice that there is some variability in the style of the index cards and
            	occasionally you might get a card that looks quite different. In such cases, please try your best
            	to fill in the requisite fields and note in the Transcriber's Comments field that you found this difficult for that
            	particular card. As we continue drawer-by-drawer through the catalog, we will look to modify the
            	input fields in response to your suggestions.
