This application will help the [British Museum](http://www.britishmuseum.org "The BM website")'s curator of the Bronze
Age collections, Neil Wilkin, to make available a huge card catalogue of British prehistoric metal artefacts discovered
in the 19th and 20th century.

This information has long been known to be an extremely important untapped resource. Metal finds are not only crucial
forms of evidence for dating Britain's prehistoric past, but also tell us a great deal about prehistoric society and economy.

Digitising the thousands of objects in this catalogue will make these records publicly available via their incorporation into the
[Portable Antiquities Scheme website](http://finds.org.uk "PAS website"). The result will be the largest national
database of prehistoric metal finds anywhere in the world and a near comprehensive view of what we currently know about
such finds in the UK.

The cards have been scanned and uploaded to [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/micropasts/), and it is from there
that the current application will retrieve and manipulate the scans. These cards contain some fairly standardised kinds
of information: about where the artefact was discovered, its dimensions, a longer description of what it looks like, etc.

What the research team would like people to do, is to transcribe the details from each section on the card into some
pre-determined fields, and also to attempt to geo-reference the object via its place of discovery.
